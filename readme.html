<p>The report_cache parameter behaves differently for the detonate file and detonate url actions. These differences are outlined below.
<br><br>
<b>Detonate File</b>
  <ul>
    <li>If caching is enabled and cookbook is provided then the caching is ignored and a new detonation analysis process is spawned</li>
    <li>If caching is enabled and cookbook is not provided then the analysis report of the latest spawned process on Joe Sandbox for the provided file hash, is returned</li>
    <li>If caching is not enabled then always a new detonation analysis process is spawned</li>
  </ul>
<b>Detonate URL</b>
  <ul>
    <li>If caching is enabled then the analysis report of the latest spawned process on Joe Sandbox for the provided URL, is returned</li>
    <li>If caching is not enabled then always a new detonation analysis process is spawned</li>
  </ul>
</p>
